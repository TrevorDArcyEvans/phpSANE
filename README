phpSANE is a web-based frontend for SANE written in HTML/PHP so you can scan with
your web-browser. It also supports OCR.

This project was originally written by "dfroe" and hosted on SourceForge at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpsane/

The original project appears to be defunct (no commits since 2013, no ability to
raise tickets), and some changes were necessary to make it work correctly with
current versions of SANE, thus I forked it to GitHub.

Installation is simple: copy the entire directory hierarchy below src/ to the
desired web root.  The service account for the HTTP daemon needs to be a member
of whatever group owns scanners (typically "scanner").

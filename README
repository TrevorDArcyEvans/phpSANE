Requirements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* SANE
* netpbm
* Apache web-server with PHP-support
* gocr (optional)

Automatic Installation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is recommended that you use the automatic installation.
To do this, you must execute ./install.sh as root.
If the automatic installation fails, please use the manual installation.

Manual Installation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 1) Copy the phpSANE-directory so your apache can access it.
    e.g.: "cp -R phpSANE /var/www/html/"
 2) Change to this directory.
    e.g.: "cd /var/www/html/phpSANE/"
 3) Change the owner of all files in this directory to the user under which your
    apache runs.
    e.g.: "chown -R www-data:www-data ."
 4) Guarantee that only your apache has access to .htaccess and tmp.
    e.g.: "chmod 0600 .htaccess; chmod 0700 tmp"
 5) Then you must change some things in the config.php.
    e.g.: "vi config.php"
 6) Normally you can skip points 7 up to 11 except you have not
    installed your programs like scanimage into /usr/bin.
 7) Change $SANE_FIND_SCANNER to the output of "which sane-find-scanner".
 8) Change $SCANIMAGE to the output of "which scanimage".
 9) Change $PNMTOTIFF to the output of "which pnmtotiff".
10) Change $PNMTOJPEG to the output of "which pnmtojpeg".
11) Change $GOCR to  the output of "which gocr".
12) Change $PHPSANE_ROOT to `pwd`.
13) phpSANE is configured that only users which are in the subnet
    192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 and in the group phpSANE have access to phpSANE.
    To change this edit the .htaccess-file.

FAQ:
^^^^
Q: phpSANE says that no scanners were found.
A: Make sure that your apache user is able to scan with scanimage.
   Your apache user must have write-access to your scanner device, too.

Requirements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* SANE
* netpbm
* Apache web-server with PHP-support

Automatic Installation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is recommended that you use the automatic installation.
To do this, you must execute ./install.sh as root.

Manual Installation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 1) Copy the phpSANE-directory so your apache can access it.
    e.g.: "cp -R phpSANE /var/www/html/"
 2) Change to this directory.
    e.g.: "cd /var/www/html/phpSANE/"
 3) Change the owner of all files in this directory to the user under which your
    apache runs.
    e.g.: "chown -R www-data:www-data ."
 4) Guarantee that only your apache has access to .htaccess and tmp.
    e.g.: "chmod 0600 .htaccess; chmod 0700 tmp"
 5) Then you must change some things in the config.php.
    e.g.: "vi config.php"
 6) Change $SANE_FIND_SCANNER to `which sane-find-scanner`.
 7) Change $SCANIMAGE to `which scanimage`.
 8) Change $PNMTOTIFF to `which pnmtotiff`.
 9) Change $PHPSANE_ROOT to `pwd`.
10) phpSANE is configured that only users which are in the subnet
    192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 and in the group phpSANE have access to phpSANE.
    To change this edit the .htaccess-file.
